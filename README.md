# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors – Fair & Fraud Versions

Welcome to my take on the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game – with a twist!

This project features **two versions** of the game, both built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**:


## 🔹 Fair Mode
> Traditional logic where the user and AI play fairly.  
Choose your move, and let chance decide who wins!

🧠 Logic File: `js/fair.js`


## 🔸 Fraud Mode
> A deceptive AI that **lets you win early**, builds your trust, and then starts **cheating** to win more often.  
It's psychological warfare in code form. 😏

🧠 Logic File: `js/fraud.js`
